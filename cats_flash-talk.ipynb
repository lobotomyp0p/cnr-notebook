    "I like cats. You probably like cats. You know who doesn't like cats? Songbirds. I see a lot of songbirds around Ann Arbor. I don't see a lot of wild cats. I'm from Southern California. In my home town there's a lot of outdoor pet cats, and a handful of feral ones. Not so many songbirds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do we do about it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not much. There's a lot of options, but the reality is that humans created this problem 10s of thousands of years ago and it's a hard problem for us to solve. It's a harder problem for the songbirds, and they can't do a thing about it. Some solutions of varying palatability:\n",

    "## Catch-Neuter-Release\n",
    "\n",
    "Catch cats. Neuter/spay them. Release them back into the \"wild\". Is this a solution? Not in the short term. Cats still hunt even if they're neutered, and they even hunt for pleasure. But it makes people feel better because 1) no one's murdering kittens 2) they don't have to take care of the cats.\n",
